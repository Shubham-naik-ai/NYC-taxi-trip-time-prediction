Let us now discuss about the problem statement for the project.
# Problem Context:

A typical taxi company faces a common problem of efficiently assigning the cabs to passengers so that the service is smooth and hassle free. One of main issue is determining the duration of the current trip so it can predict when the cab will be free for the next trip.

The data set contains the data regarding several taxi trips and its duration in New York City. I will now try and apply different techniques of Data Analysis to get insights about the data and determine how different variables are dependent on the target variable Trip Duration.



## Demographic information of Customer & Vendor
id : a unique identifier for each trip

vendor_id : a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record

passenger_count : the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)

## Information about the Trip
pickup_longitude : date and time when the meter was engaged

pickup_latitude : date and time when the meter was disengaged

dropoff_longitude : the longitude where the meter was disengaged

dropoff_latitude : the latitude where the meter was disengaged

store_and_fwd_flag : This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server (Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip)

trip_duration : (target) duration of the trip in seconds

Thus we have a data set with 729322 rows and 11 columns. There are 10 features and 1 target variable which is trip_duration

## Conclusion about Trip Duration and the data set:
Trip Duration varies a lot ranging from few seconds to more than 20 hours

Most trips are taken on Friday , Saturday and Thursday

The average duration of a trip is most on Thursday and Friday as trips longer than 5 hours are mostly taken in these days

The average duration of trips started in between 14 hours and 17 hours is the largest.

Vendor 2 mostly provides the longer trips

The long duration trips(> 5 hours) are mostly concentrated with their pickup region near (40 째,75 째) to (42째,75째)

From above table we see GradientBoosting has worked well.
